## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Terminal doesn't open or shows blank screen**
- Ensure Python 3 is installed and accessible via `python3` command

**Commands not working properly**
- Verify you're in the correct directory (`pwd`)
- Check that your shell environment is properly configured
- Some commands requiring TTY interaction may not work perfectly

**Plugin conflicts**
